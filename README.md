This is the repository for Modern Information Retrieval Course, Instructed by Dr. Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah at Sharif University of Technology.

## What is this project about?
One of the ways to compare movies and understand which one is a better choice for you, is through websites with this purpose and using appropriate information retrieval methods.

In this phase of project, we begin our journey towards building an information retrieval system for [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/) website. In this phase, we crawl the required datas from [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/) and do some preprocessing on them. [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/) has one of the reachest datasets of movies (with their ratings, comments, actors and etc.).

## General Structure
The project contains 2 main modules: `Logic` and `UI`. The `Logic` module is responsible for doing the main tasks of the project and the `UI` module is responsible for providing a user interface for the user to interact with the system. In each task, you will be told to implement a part or a whole file in one of these modules. Please read the comments for each file and functions inside it to understand what you need to do.
